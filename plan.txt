- create a basic html and add js
- add a json object that simulates db
- add phaser and implement basic menu and game layout
- add logic about picking categories/words
    - should work with any number of categories/words
- add logic about covering words
    - should work no matter of how many words the conundrum is
- add logic about selecting letters (buttons on the screen or keyboard input?)
    - so far only keyboard input, will add buttons if I have the time (figure out how to do it without code duplication)
- add logic about typing the whole word (input box in phaser?)
- add statistics (cookies, localStorage, phaser.save()?)
